came friend restaurant week last night
place large sort cavernous dimly lit
told running late ended waiting around 20 minute table
regular price looked pretty expensive 15 per appetizer 35 per entre restaurant week menu 35pp seemed like sweet deal
though party told could get appetizer entree dessert portion would adjusted accordingly
guess everythings served family style
chose vegetable dumpling lamb sparerib start
thought dumpling good shreaded vegetable stuffed thin skin pan fried drowned slightly spicy tangy red sauce
rib came huge pile aromatic grilled brushed sweet hoisin like sauce
entree chose bbq salmon grilled skirt steak
salmon cooked medium really fresh detected fishy taste
little bland though didn really detect bbq taste
steak cooked medium rare tender came sauce lamb
steak also came pile lo mein noodle springy tasty
dessert choose got cheesecake mousse trio sorbet ice cream
cheesecake pretty good light cheesecake
sorbet normal good ending meal
overall dont think food good cheap enough come good time
good vibrant midtown place take people want wow nyc ness
food rich flavorful
waitress proactive courteous helpful
bit loud impossibly
lamb spare rib sweet succulent lobster mashed potato wow duck entree tasted like juicy steak mousse dessert
thing usually prefer eat loved every bite
expensive 100 per person ordered moderately expensive bottle wine dessert think 100 person decent
dinner girlfriend china grill ok experience
business guest town coming seemed decent choice
wrong 15pm reservation 9pm still seated embarassing business dinner client
host explanation could control people finish dinner
reservation first place would left gone another restaurant host kept saying table opening minute people paid etc except went check table ordering dessert
left 15pm another restaurant promptly got seated
definitely good impression client
start lost reservation instead trying fix mistake made u wait almost hour seated
finally seated u service sucked place loud food bland priced
perhaps read line
fact resteraunt staff couldn even keep reservation straight mention screwing told u go scratch made u wait almost hour
retrospect gone mcdonalds made wait couple hour eat told could saved dollar food
suggestion would eat elsewhere
pan asian fare
shared many dish none really stood except spinach wow happening loud place hear speak group
took seated
service ordered became snail paced
bathroom kool
bar scene packed lot pretty people

restaurant music loud four people able converse ventilation horrible
smelt like restaurant day

least got discount lost favorite place
ll never catch
place could something poor manager understand proper etiquette serving dining
bottom line music great listen ambiance small yet right
getting greedy customer lack proper service
truly shame
never going back place service terrible
complained waitress sangria awful asked talk owner
never turned discus proceeded glare u across restaurant
settled bill ready leave waitress came back question whether tip lower end scale didn like sangria
told would happy owner comp sangria give amount charged 30 tip owner left although music ambience great many tapa bar new york better service attitude

however similarity fish type yellowtail type white tuna made difficult distinguish
better way spend 50 buck probably get platter piece roll 20 buck give good solid dose extremely high quality sushi well quantity
add exotic piece high quality eel fatty tuna totaly like 35 dollar
lastly get toro roll
sushi yasuda small selection sushi roll traditional serf

girl night dinner restaurant week
disappointed pre fixe menu choice per course restaurant offer choice ended ordering la carte
thoroughly enjoyed food annoying scream across table conversation
also convinced waiter zombie appeared difficulty focusing spoke
boyfriend recently early dinner artisanal satisfied experience
began cheese fondue artisanal blend added apple kielbasa dip
careful portion re huge
pretty much full fondue appetizer
cod paella spicy filling big eater could eat half boyfriend classic fish chip big serving least piece fish basketful fry
ended dinner surprisingly light flaky apple tarte tatin
dinner wine ended costing around 130
bad deal consider flavorful large portion
apology restaurant week
free drink
butter melted white wine warm cheese oozing everywhere
million better place go city
evening artisanal resembled dinner subway platform
ambient temperature inside must mid high 80
noise level always pretty high combined basically unbearable
although evening began well enough bar temperature steadily rose dinner reservation time approached
taken lead party got left
hostess told u due steam pipe floor july
learned truth customer escaped street air conditioning
restaurant stature respect customer
last evening may fine dinner excellent wine
however memory dinner overshadowed horrible condition inside restaurant deceptive explanation
returning train
first thought upon entering dining room good god place loud
feeling never deviated
picture elegantly set table exact middle main room grand central station
dining artisanal like
friend ordered prix fixe menu restaurant week 35
00 appetizer entree desert food quite good
prosecco tried order stock cote du rhone settled afterwords far warm drink though server offered chill u
food simple tasty restaurant lack intimate atmosphere deserving fine food created kitchen
therefore cannot say dining experience ultimately good one
shorftalls restaurant obvious
went artisanal advice wine food writer could happier service fantastic food even better
cheese plate ordered fondue day fontina white truffel oil
heavenly wine list extensive waiter fine job helping u choose perfect wine meal
fantastic cheese adventure possible downside noisy good choice intimate dining
enjoyed energy restaurant though certainly return next visit nyc

waiter knowledgeable steered u towards great selection
food mostly non cheese related fantastic
non alcoholic cocktail tasted like dream well
never dinner say brunch definitely top notch

wine list way expensive
cheapest bottle 50 trying prove worth charging much wine
yesterday celebrate easter group friend

must admit far restaurant week go artisanal quite good job
service throughout night good experience attitude part staff

main course rather sparse nothing great
ask cheese menu since specialize 200 cheese
interrupted waiter say done dinner bring one
gee
maybe wanted cheese appetizer course service cold except hostess charming
little pricey cold service
ll probably try others going back
though cheese hit mark table service unfortunate afterthought
scene familiar erzatz bistro namely set real thing
paris dining room proportion decor often seem fulfill divine law service move like ballet
fawlty tower come often mind venue never fails outright raw oyster excellent salad honest nicely composed main satisfying
one could spend many visit exploring cheese guidance friendly sophisticated cheese master reason visit artisanal
unfortunately kitchen effort matched table service perfunctory disjointed uninformed mostly absent
cheese get short shrift waitstaff seem hurried
dont go late light dim suddenly 10 40 better rush closing
rather disappointed restaurant
ve read many great review give try
service adequate best
couldn understand work waiting speaking
mention fact farely gave u time day let alone attention restaurant calibur
fondue soup great entree terrible average
make reservation food delectable truly magnificent
gougeres escargot must
entree carefully crafted show
ask server sommelier match wine extensive great value list never failed
cap spend time fromaggier select world finest cheese pate
oh dessert worth talking
must eat cheese fondue usually special one favorite made carmelized onion medium rare beef tip never bad experience
nose acclimates pungent stench cheese smooth sailing great food wine
dining artisanal probably one many incorrectly added total amount credited charge
reviewing card balance noticed mistake artisanal pulled copy bill credited acct mistake
pleasure dealing management
additionally loved entree cheese plate dessert enjoyable experience
went sunday afternoon
place nice welcoming
restaurant offer typical french fare oeufs steak frites salad nicoise etc
nothing special exception cheese menu
real reason go
love cheese huge menu delicous
otherwise also good course 20 brunch bargain
think would go meal would buy cheese shop inside leave
heard artisanal cheese temple nyc cheese lover check
ate bar started amazing bowl french onion soup cheese chose different cheese menu well 100 wine list extensive impressive tried different white perfect massive cheese intake
noticed many comment negative thing say service food thought suggestion eat bar avoid rude waiter bad service artisanal reputation based cheese get cheese steak whatever
go known
cheese reason go
decor nice service bit spotty fondue cheese best city
went recently first likely last time
annoyed wait even though made reservation
unbelievably hot inside type usually cold room
waiter wasn unattentive took long time get u order take order get u check
asked special dessert since celebrating someone birthday never showed
actually relieved cause ready leave
paid 60 person drink appetizer entree tax le average tip
food nothing special though fondue good
heard good thing restaurant people respect
last night hot outside air conditioning restaurant sub standard
hot sticky
food
case worse
appetizer escargot biscuit sauce salty inedible
dover sole 38 lost texture taste
restaurant noisy table close together
really like cheese willing put everything else pay counting tip 180 two place
otherwise stay clear
food cheese quite good however
uncomfortably warm
complained time improvement
eating uncomfortable miserable made matter worse lack concern
anyone apologize door
way little way late sorry many resturants ny put poor service
recently dined artisanal given gift certificate
went read review posted city search
say overall impressed
decor nice restaurant high ceiling tiled floor noisey
music also strange appropriate restaurant
appetizer good worth price entree another restaurant
dover sole good friend lamb bone meat
importantly service impersonal rushed
although water glass never left empty numerous server felt like guard hurrying u
bottom line many good french restaurant
go one priced bad service great food
like dressed pastis
go anything go cheese fondu good finishing cheese selection
fromage winner everything else truly valueless
tried escargo ok blue ribbon sullivan supreme
steak pom frittes 23
disappointed
tasted fine would expected small filet instead micro portion pre cut slice
came ketchup since steak pom frittes come ketchup like chef telling side steak utter junk right get go
service despite reviewer claim suprisingly good
nothing magical place feel dining last night
cheese outstanding entree drink service lacking
enjoy french food certain thing unaware various dish
french waiter seemed annoyed asking many question offered little assistance helping choose right dish
atmosphere steak house loud romantic ordinay decor
would recommend like cheese 140 bill come average meal
go eat nyc quite often eager try artisanal
one word overrated
get wrong love cheese specialty
wasn even much cheese menu
maybe expecting much honestly didn see fromage hoopla
would say everything group tried could best described eh
price eh doesn cut
service get started
want server attention bring flare
slight chance someone might respond
maybe exposed much cheese prolonged period time adverse effect one personality
theory
advice skip artisanal
mood cheese grab cracker barrel
95 gristede call day
atmosphere food artisanal pleasant tasty respectively service inexusable place possibly self appointed caliber
rude impatient even informed
however rest staff great loved cheese expert fyi mesculin salad may well salad mix costco bad dressing
service actually good end meal waitress obviously took turn worse decided throwing dessert menu table would effective way get tip
food great put le par service
needle say dessert tip standard
apparently bar staff artisanal receive memo poor economy importance retaining customer ruining excellent food experience
instead customer service bar deemed le important discussion personal life maybe make grade movie someday staff
guess life described donald judd sculpture untitled minimal concept service tough grasp
hopefully management give time near future replace malcontent congenial fun cheese cave personnel
like joint murray hill
food great service fine

anyway space absolutely beautiful pretentious way
felt comfortable dressed casually
service friendly professional
needed overly fussy
menu large interesting
steak amongst best ve suckling pig roast open kitchen rotisserie tender flavorful
saying restaurant pricey may clue poor review
found price reasonable especially large portion
seated table upstairs overlooked first floor dining room
fine like people watch although bird eye view watching people eat isn particularly appealing intimate
started 16 crab cake appetizer quite small average tasting
entree lamb excellent flavorful tender
rib eye sounded promising onion herb relish le tender relish didn seem much enhance flavor
side dish additional au gratins good asparagus tasted bland
general service good busboy particularly attentive food exception lamb average especially price
although restaurant beautiful wouldn recommend romantic dinner seems better suited larger group
boyfriend went restaurant week saturday night show
pre fixe menu allowed u three course meal 30 much lower would normally pay place three course meal
plus pay side
side spinach cost extra food average worth price charge
soup appetizer interesting one
rib eye steak cost additional charred outside rubbery inside
salmon decent drenched oil
could get dish anywhere much cheaper price
coffee cheesecake pretty good end thing left feeling pretty much disappointed
place young crowd
young people like u around 30 10 year average patron age
although restaurant wasn nearly filled waited half hour seated despite reservation
first seated broken table
upon moving u another place forgot give u butter water
picky stuff place claim high end steakhouse seafood restaurant
entree completely spoiled night
know asking 32 veal venison chop well done mean bloody inside charcoal outside got
burnt beyond recognition camouflaged overly strong sauce
though mashed potato side excellent could help wife feeling rock stomach mid next day

sad people one country would treat fellow citizen cold contempt

one place good dim sum night time
scene new york south african restaurant first opened back 1999 certain ramshackle charm evoked night edge veldt
since madiba doubled size replaced kerosene lantern giant colorful painting africa
food served wooden camping table drink come small metal mug
also lounging area band performance troupe entertain
food unique dish include potjie similar oxtail stew bunny chow hollowed loaf bread containing vegetable curry bobotie curried meat boiled egg pie scratching surface
safari platter dried meat stick dark meat appeal mainstream palate tender ostrich tasty seafood dish like octopus peri peri adventurous eater
ve lived neighborhood year always good time madiba
service really friendly much alot place area
food delicious definitely different everything else dekalb strip
downside totally overpriced
whiskey get thing almost anywhere else
guess re paying atmosphere bit much
still go back every often always feel welcome
south african excited check new york south african restaurant
bothered disappointment
walk overcrowded space decorated tourist kitsch feel plastic cheaply produced high school play
bartender took 10 minute polishing glass trying establish cool south african attitude deigned look direction
course south african beer could actually order multitude south african beer bottle behind bar decoration
ordered mojito capirinha
mojito took minute
proceded make sangria serve wine etc
ignoring u another 10 minute
finally cancelled order charged 16 bland mojito
spare one love
excelent place recomend everybody want great night
think place authentic wait staff reminded one person sort know south africa
well charlize theron
nice almost cynical bit aware south african selling identity south african capitalizing interest south africa
thing shrimp spicy good
also pretty cool stuff around decor
free jest magazine bathroom
recently visited madiba lunch waitress sweet ineffective
took u forever get menu drink begged arrive food way overpriced tasty
madiba open kitchen layout mean dishwashing machine never far sitting
waitress gall ask u close check brought food could go home rather wait u finish hey babe waited wait u
authentic south african side dish great enjoyed trying something new
think go back
reservation 30pm
waiting hour owner offered u free round drink forgot actually deliver
entree served u 11 00pm
second time restuarant time disappointing
really want like place advice stay away get act together
ever
ve twice time food atmosphere delightful
although first time probably better two time special day whole whiting size plate doused amazing flavor
would also highly recommend bread pudding dessert
although price may considered steep end especially neighborhood nice place quiet homestyle dinner sunday night
south african would say
space great shebeen vibe cocktail creative enjoyable convey sense theater drink drastically overpriced ft
greene
also food essentially peasant food style dish various ethnicity sa priced like dinner pastis
food okay suppose novel basically good street cart food
price absurd
also ve found staff incompetent many occasion worse totally aloof unapolagetic multitude screw ups one encounter
lowered price 25 got decent help fair value fun experience instead leave feeling ripped
first moved neighborhood several year ago madiba better priced relaxed
go top 75 dinner two including drink tip make pay per person music
isn 75 enough think really poor taste charge cover music going nice dinner spend significant money come brooklyn say mojitos fun drink best around
madiba original decor bit flamboyant nice vibe
good thing dining brooklyn fuss red rope policy seating space always available neighborhood feeling manhattan price dinner two come around 50
ouch cocktail drink best place offer caipirinhas caipiroskas mojitos served large glass jar friut bit
try durban samoosas avoid ostrich carpaccio
main course pretty spicy prepared try bobotie prawn bunny chow
service unexplicably slow considering place almost empty
also singer night made conversation dinner basically impossible
come back probably enjoy nice caipirinha outdoor summer food though
madiba one place make sure take visitor
decor unusual ecclectic food generously proportioned arrives quickly
cocktail strong large although bit expensive
staff fantastic friendly part neighborhood
way madibaechoes woe neighborhood restaurant service bit relaxed time energy liveliness make plus warm smile go long way great place go group friend whether stop work cocktail rum punch divine full meal
menu eclectic something everyone
also recommend visit monday carribean night menu selection island twist live band set inside
say re hurry quick efficient meal might happier elsewhere enjoy leisure meal friendly atmosphere ll probably hooked
bit mysitfied squabbling
nothing madiba get excited
madiba perfectly adequate middling restaurant nice neighborhood decent ambience loyal clientele
vouch whether place represents authentic taste home longed transplanted ex pat food fine somewhat priced
better le money various place block notably liquor lou lou exoticism appeal ll probably enjoy
said ought destination restaurant
re neighborhood really bored friday night fine otherwise try something actually worth trip
think quaint waitress referred date mama
native south african say food nothing like real thing
dish bland badly prepared remotely taste like mother cooking
eaten almost every dish menu back south africa madibas really representative sa food

escargot jenny poorly prepared tasted like salt lick delicacy
fois gras overcooked poor quality
steak au poivre good worth price
date filet mignon came table string still attached

overall found experience embarrassing restaurant
food hit miss hit mean 10
dessert absolutely awful
service good though
bottom line go food
mediocre
uws creature stirring even jean luc
