pale ale brewed toasted pecans nice flavor frankly worth opening one
beer pours clearish cloudy orange thick retentive head sweet light brown sugar light hops oily sesame taste

pecan presence noticeable finish crisp dry flavor precisely like fresh pecans
southern lovely brews like make believe ever deeply drinking local
call beer terroir

nose detect malted grain spoiled aforementioned
fact still manage extract sense straw says little something least completely ridden corn
taste ripe sweet yellow corn quenching finish straw malt
flavour saturated damp grains give weight palate damp far responsible grain bill
little watery better adjuncty
aftertaste unpleasantness minimal although complete absence bitterness allows lot sweetness go unchecked
ive seen green bottles open six packs far west california far east poland
ive never issue id advise change canadas oldest independent brewery fact offer lager little cleaner drinking foreign owned counterparts
drink cold expect expected
coming 500ml bottle bb served chilled weizen glass
dark yellowish straw colour pillowy white froth high level carbonation
lightly sweet grainy lightly grassy plus hint sour dough
swirl manages bring bit malt sweetness
understated overall unpleasant cheap
clean palate flavour balance gears towards lager malts plus little sourness lager beer residual grassy taste plastic undertone dry northern german pilsener lightly dry palate aftertaste ring bell hops
much unpleasant grainy flavour left end rather quite clean neutral taste
